	<h3>What is Risk</h3>
	<p>
		Risk is the danger of investing. When you put your money into a market, you can either win (get more of it), or lose (get less of it). The risk is basically the probability that you will lose your money with your investment.

	<h3>Pros</h3>
	<p>
		There's a truth in risk that states that the higher it is, the higher your returns. In almost every investment, risk is a complement to your investment, meaning it grows with it at a certain rate based on how safe the investment is. Bigger companies with a copious amount of money to keep them afloat will be a less risky investment, but will lead up with minimal returns. If you have an appetite for risk, and can do your research well, then you may be able to pull off insane returns in a short period of time.

	<h3>Cons</h3>
	<p>
		While it's true that you can pull off big winnings, huge losses could also occur with any company at any risk level. It is important that you do your research on the companies that you invest in so that you can actually see if the company is worth investing in. Just throwing your money into a stock you know nothing about is probably the biggest risk you could take, and it doesn't correlate your risk with your investment right. You could unknowingly take the biggest risk of your life and just lose all of your money. So becareful, because your money depends on it.
