	<p>
		The goal of a portfolio is to help you make money. It shows you what you're invested in, how much everything is worth, and all the current market data that you want it to show. It is a way in which the flow of your money is shown, portraying strengths and weaknesses within itself for improvement and efficiency.

It shows how they breakdown their portfolios, performance results for different stocks that they have, and the distribution of their money into different sections of investing. This is a prime example of a good portfolio set up, and with a little magic in google sheets, you too can make a portfolio that is set up like this.
