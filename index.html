		<h3>What Is Investing?</h3>
		<p>
			Investing is what makes your dreams come true. It makes money grow at a fast rate so that when you say, get your paycheck, a portion of it may be put away to make increasted returns. I'll use an example to make it easy for you to grasp the idea of investing.

			<br>
			Say the United States makes every male person go to war whenever they are needed (Drafting System). While soldiers are at war, they are away from their families. Think of this as your dollar paying the bills and such that you may have. When the United States declares peace, the soldiers go home to their families until they are called upon again. They move on with their lives and when called upon they go back to war. While at home, they have children, making the supply of the army greater over time. Think of the children as the newly produced dollar that you have from investing your money. It gives you more resources in order to do more.

			Investing, as defined in the google dictionary, means to "expend money with the expectation of achievinga profit or material result by putting it into financial schemes, shares, or property, or by using it to develop a commercial venture".

		<h3>Education and Practice</h3>
		<p> 
			Smart investments create smart money. Think of it as a way of making more money, so long as you know what you're getting yourself into and have the foresight to find opportunities to invest into.

			It's not easy, but it's also not hard. The first step to become a successful investor is (like every skill known to man) takes research and practice, and a lot of it. The better you are, the better investments you will make, and the more money you will make in the long run.
			<br>
			<h2>How to Research</h2>
			<p>
			One of the easiest ways to research is through practice. Now, I know, a lot of people don't want to waste their money predicated on their own ignorance. I understand, but there's a solution to the issue. Just do the following steps:
			</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open an Investopedia Account.</li>
					<li>Go to the Investopedia Stock Market Simulation</li>
					<li>Join any game of your choosing, and invest like you would in any stock market!</li>
				</ol>

		<h2>One Thing to Note</h2>
		<p>
			This website is about investing in the stocks, bonds, etf's, and cryptocurrency markets solely. The primary focus is growing money in this way. It is acknowledged that there are other ways to invest your money, and some may actually even be better than this way, but that is not the focus of this website and will not be covered on this website.
