		<h3>Value Investing</h3>
		<p>
			This type of investing focuses on something called Fundamental Analysis. This sort of analysis is considered "old school", as it has to do with how investors such as Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio may have invested into markets. Value investing focuses on essentially five ideas:
		</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The Intrinsic Value of Companies</li>
					<li>Margins of Safety</li>
					<li>Market Efficiency is a Myth</li>
					<li>Herding is Bad</li>
					<li>Patience is Key</li>
				</ol>
		<p>
			The idea behind these five fundamentals is that if you follow them, you will have a set strategy that will work basically forever. The idea is to look into a company to see if it has a good reputation, make sure their mission is clear and great, and to see if they are being sold at a good price. If everything checks out, and the numbers are phenomenal, you invest and in time get phenomenal returns.

		<h3>Income Investing</h3>
		<p>
			The goal of income investing is to put your money into stocks that pay dividends. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that is divided between each share and given out to each shareholder based on how many shares they have. These payments are given out periodically and vary from company to company. You get these dividend payments and invest it back into more stocks, thereby growing your money. One thing that you may want to look out for with this strategy is taxes, which can whittle your money away quickly. 
		</p>

		<h3>Growth Investing</h3>
		<p>
			The idea behind this strategy is to grow your capital through investments. You invest your money in a specific types of stock called "Growth Stocks". These stocks are stocks of companies with great earnings reports each quarter and are expected to have great earnings over time. You basically buy and sell based on statistics.

		<h3>Small Cap Investing</h3>
		<p>
			This type of investing is where risk is a big player. Small Cap Investing is very risky, because you deal with companies that have a small market cap and that are considered pennystocks, where their shares are worth pennies and easy to get. The risk here is that these companies are so small that they could fail very easy and you could lose your investment. The payoff is huge for this type of investing, and if you play your cards right and can deal with the risk, you can put your money into small cap and see how it goes.
